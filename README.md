# This project is created to test the basic concepts of Gherkin/Cucumber/Selenium

## The project explains two concepts

- A simple standalone application copied as is from Cucumber official documentation which explains the concept of Feature building and its corresponding test.
- The second application uses Chrome Driver to launch Chrome and test end to end. The Chrome driver is embeded within the code. Not sure this is a good practice. But anyone who downloads the code can execute it within the sandbox
- This is a sample commit
